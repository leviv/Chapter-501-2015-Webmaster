The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has calculated that, "recycling one million laptops saves the energy equivalent to the electricity used by 3657 U.S. homes in a year". </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s">When disposing of a computer, you must first make sure that all your personal information is cleared. Remember to back up all your personal data if needed. Then, like TVs, they should not be disposed of in a landfill or be shipped overseas. Many retail electronic stores have programs that will take used computers. The map below provides locations for desktop or laptop disposal. Call ahead to find out which companies will pick up your used computer for a small fee or no cost at all.</p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s">Phones are one of the most frequently disposed electoronic items. Remember to back up all your personal data if needed.

                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s">Batteries should not be thrown in a trash can and sent curbside. Many batteries contain heavy metals, which will contaminate the environment if not responsibly disposed. It is best to treat all batteries (including car batteries) as hazardous waste and recycle them properly. If you plan to ship batteries, shipping regulations require that both terminal ends are taped or each battery is individually bagged.
                    The map below provides locations for battery disposal. </p>
