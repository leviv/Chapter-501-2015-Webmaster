# 2015 TSA 501 Webmaster Website

This was one of the earlies websites I ever made for the annual [Technology Student Association](https://tsaweb.org/) webmaster competition. We placed 1st in the regional competition and 5th in state.

## Development

Original versions of this website were made using PHP to simplify redundantly including headers/footers, but I since converted to a static site to easily host it online. Simply checkout the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:leviv/Chapter-501-2015-Webmaster.git
```

and open `index.html` to start developing locally.
